<h2>Languages</h2> 


<p>
The best thing about growing up in Morocco was the diversity in cultures and languages. Morocco has Berber, Arabic, French, and Spanish influences. Moreover, I studided in an American School my entire academic path. Hence, I speak fluent French, Arabic, and English. I'm also taking Spanish classes this year at ESSEC in the hopes of enriching my knowledge and capacities in languages.

My absolute favorite thing to do is traveling. I have traveled in 13 countries and 34 different cities total. I love to travel around the globe to discover new landscapes, people, cultures and trying out new food. To me, there is nothing more enriching than a travel experience.
